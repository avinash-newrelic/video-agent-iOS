## Documentation

To generate source code documentation, you can use [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc) as follows:

```bash
appledoc --project-name NewRelicVideoAgent --project-company "New Relic Inc." --company-id com.newrelic --create-html --no-create-docset --output ./docs NewRelicVideoCore/NewRelicVideoCore/**/*.h
```

And then open `docs/html/index.html` with your prefered browser.

The source code annotations are compatible with Doxygen, so you would rather use it if you prefer.

For more detail on the Events and Data Model generated by Video Agent for Android and for advanced concepts such as creating custom trackers, reference the [Advanced Topics](advanced.md) manual.
